With increased automation in the fields of language analysis, new possibilities emerge to gain insights on different social topics. Due to the fact that explainable machine learning models need to be applied to gain insights on these topics, various different approaches in this direction have been developed. As such an approach to explain natural language models is the POLAR framework, we take a deeper look at the methodology and expand it. In our research we applied the POLAR framework to gain insights on business entities. Dividing our paper into three parts we applied first clustering and PCA to conduct a graphical analysis of word embeddings. Then, we checked the quality of the selected POLAR dimensions with an annotator test. In the second part we analyzed bias in the different embeddings through t-tests. In the third part we analyzed the cultural differences between the embedded entities with Hofstede's framework. Using these different approaches we try to gain insights about the business embeddings and evaluate the approaches to see how they perform and how robust they are.
